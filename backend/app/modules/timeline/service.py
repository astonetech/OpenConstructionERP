"""Timeline service - read queries over the existing activity-log store.

The timeline is a cross-module rollup view. A row belongs to a project's
timeline when either:

* it was logged with ``parent_entity_id`` == the project id (the normal case
  for module events that carry their umbrella project - RFIs, NCRs, change
  orders, ...), or
* it was logged directly against the project itself
  (``entity_id`` == the project id), e.g. a ``project.status_changed`` row.

No new table and no migration: this reads :class:`app.core.audit_log.ActivityLog`.
