"""Pure event-to-timeline mapping (no app.* imports, py3.11-testable).

The unified project timeline is built on top of the existing activity-log
store (``oe_activity_log``). A bridge subscriber listens to the in-memory
event bus and persists the *significant* cross-module domain events so the
timeline survives a restart (the event bus itself is in-memory only).

This module is deliberately dependency-free: it imports only the standard
library so it can be unit-tested under Python 3.11 without standing up the
application, a database, or the event bus. Every function is defensive and
never raises - a malformed event must never break the publisher.

Naming contract
---------------
Events follow dot-notation ``{module}.{entity}.{action}`` (see
``app.core.events``), e.g. ``changeorder.approved``, ``rfi.created``,
``schedule.baseline.set``. We treat an event as significant when its name
starts with one of :data:`ALLOWLIST_PREFIXES`. The allowlist is intentionally
narrow so high-volume, low-signal chatter (``boq.position.created``,
``cad.import.progress``, ...) never floods the timeline.
